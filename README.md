# NVC-Augmented-Reality-Unity-Demo
A unity project demonstrating vuforia's Augmented Reality SDK

In the AR Demo folder download androidDemo.apk, this is an executable for an android app.  The app brings up a camera you can point at http://i.imgur.com/DYnRLMc.jpg as well as a few Magic(TM) cards.

The image rocks.jpg is a great example.  It has many focus points and doesnt repeat a pattern anywhere.  For this reason it is ideal for testing.
